In this exercise I was putting into practice the bracket notation concept to find the index of characters in a string apart from this I also used the length -1 to find the last character in a string. Also the workshop incorporates the template literal (`) to do string concatenation which is pretty easier than using the +, +=, or concat () method also I use the template literal to create multi lines without having to incoporate the backslash character. Lastly I have used the indexOf to find the position of a string in a substring. I also learned about the prompt() function which is used to get input from users then outputs it as a message.
