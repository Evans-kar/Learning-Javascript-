This workshop was based on the continued string method functions,  replace (), replaceAll(), and repeat(). The replace method helps developers replace a value in a string but it only replaces the first value hence that is where the replace all comes in helping to replace all instances of the value in a string. the repeat helps developers to repeat the instances of a string a specific number of times.
