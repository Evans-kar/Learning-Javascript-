In this workshop I learned more string methods in javascript such as the trim() method which is used to remove whitespaces from the beginning and at the end of a string. I also learned the trimStart () method which removes the space at the start of the string. another method is the trimEnd () this removes the whitespace at the end of a string. Also I learned the toUpperCase () method which modifies all the characters in a string to uppercase as I have learned before strings are immutable hence they cannot be changed thus. this returns a new string. the toLowerCase () method converts to lowercase all the characters in a string and it is in scenarios where the developer wants to standardize all user inputs especially in a case-insensitive scenario. at the end of the project i recouped on how to use the slice () method which i learned in my previous lesson yesterday.
